# Neural-Net-Classifiers
Host of classification problems solved with Neural Network

The aim of this project is to build extensive deeplearning classifiers on various datasets. As the Support Vector Machines run very slow on very large datasets, there comes the need to apply Neural Networks and Deeplearning for such classifications.

In each classification, we implement the most basic classification algorithms ranging from the perceptron to NN with 2 to 50 hidden-layers and compare their results.
  - Perceptron
  - Logistic Regression
  - DL with 3-50 Layers

Activation functions used:
  - Sigmoid function
  - Hyperbolic Tangent function (TANH)
  - Rectified Linear Unit (RELU)
  - Leaky Rectified Linear Unit (Leaky RELU)
